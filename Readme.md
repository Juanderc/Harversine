This application use the Harversine method(**[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)**) to calculate
the distance between two address, using the latitude and 
logitude.

We have a library to import all the others modules, and 
then create a function to be called in the **app** file of 
the root.

To use it we only have to put the address, using the address
by args and then passing the address.

Example http://localhost:port/distance/address=New York

This app have a container too.
